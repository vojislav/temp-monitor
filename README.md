# temp-monitor
A simple temperature monitor for Linux based systems. The code is set to loop a 100 times with 1 second gaps inbetween. You can change the number of loops and the gap time to fit your needs.

The only thing that is needed for this script to work is a package called "sensors". You can easily install it with the command:
<code>sudo apt install sensors</code>
